1. Payment transformation overview  - what and why?

2. Current landscape - 
	- Vendor driven monoliths (EMTS, GMTS)
	- Ageing middleware systems like Payment Broker based on IBM web methods (clunky, black box, complex troubleshooting and frequent issues)
	
3. Future Landscape - 
	- Adhere to BIAN philosophy
	- Follow BIAN prescribed banking domains - payment order, payment executions (BIAN - payment domain) and payment gateway (BIAN - integrations domain)
	- Payment Order
		>> Integration with payment origination channels
		>> Message validations and acknowledgments
		>> Message transformations if required
		>> Message enrichment if required
		>> Message routing based on payment to final execution engine
		>> Ack/Nack delivery to customer origination channels

	- Payment Execution
		>> Payment type specific execution engines (WIRES, IP, ACH) etc
		>> Each payment execution engine will have its lifecycle and integrations. E.g. - WIRES includes
			- Account Validations
			- TIER enrichments
			- Sanctions, EPCL and Fraud Screening
			- Funds controls
			- RCS
			- Integrations with Payment Gateway
			- Reporting data txmissions
			- Fee and pricing txmissions
			- Final posting and settlement

	- Payment Gateway 
		>> Integration of internal bank payment systems with external partner systems and networks
		>> Currently working n getting this integrated with FED WIRE
		>> EPG responsibilities include
			- Final message validations
			- Message transformation to outgoing format from UPO
			- Reliably post message to external FED WIRE interface - MQ
			- Acknowledge posting back to EPE
			- Offer similar integrations to other networks 


4. Data consolidations
	- EPODS is the system that will collate data from all the above mentioned systems and feed to EPODS
	- EPODS is the data store that will slice and dice and present data to consumers
	- feed to reporting and analytics systems
	- long term- data from here can be used to deliver customer, compliance and operations reports
