Introduction (Business Need)

In the real estate industry, fair and accurate appraisals are crucial for maintaining consumer trust and for the proper functioning of the housing market. However, evidence suggests that appraisal values can be affected by systemic biases, particularly racial bias, leading to significant disparities in the valuations of similar properties based on neighborhood demographics. This not only affects individual homeowners but can perpetuate long-standing economic inequalities and erode the integrity of the financial system. There is a critical business need for an objective, transparent, and equitable appraisal process, which is vital for lenders, insurers, investors, and all stakeholders in real estate transactions.

Challenge Description

The challenge is to develop a technological solution that can assist appraisers in generating objective and fair property valuations, free from the influence of racial or other irrelevant demographic biases. The solution should ensure appraisals are reflective of a property's true market value, independent of subjective human perceptions or historical data tainted with bias. It should also provide a consistent methodology that can be applied across diverse geographic locations and property types.

Objectives

Task 1: Create an Automated Valuation Model (AVM) that incorporates bias detection and mitigation techniques.
Task 2: Develop a standardized reporting tool for appraisers to use, which includes a comprehensive checklist and minimizes subjective input.
Task 3: Implement a blockchain-based ledger system to ensure transparency and immutability of appraisal records.
Task 4: Design a feedback mechanism that allows for the contestation and review of appraisals, incorporating this input into continuous learning for the system.
Prerequisites

Sample data set of property appraisals from various neighborhoods with diverse demographic profiles.
Access to demographic data, real estate market trends, and historical property valuation records.
Legal frameworks and ethical guidelines governing the use of data and algorithmic decision-making.
Example

An example implementation could be a cloud-based platform where appraisers input property data, which is then processed by the AVM. The system would produce a valuation range, flag potential biases for review, and record the appraisal on a blockchain ledger. A dashboard would display real-time analytics of appraisal trends by demographic area.

User Stories

As a mortgage processor in the home mortgage unit, I want to ensure that the appraisal values I receive for loan collateral are unbiased and accurate so that the bank can make informed lending decisions.
As a compliance officer in the home mortgage unit, I need a system that flags potentially biased appraisals so I can review them and ensure our bank is in compliance with fair lending laws.
As a home loan applicant from a historically undervalued neighborhood, I want confidence that my home's appraisal is based on objective criteria, ensuring I have equal access to lending opportunities.
Conclusion

By addressing the challenge of appraisal bias, the proposed solution aims to improve fairness in the real estate market, enhance the credibility of property valuations, and support the principles of equal opportunity in home financing.
