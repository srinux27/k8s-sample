**Subject: Farewell and Heartfelt Thanks**

Dear All,

As I prepare to move on after 15 incredible years with this company, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude to each of you. Your support and collaboration have enriched my time here, and I have learned so much from every one of you.

Together, weâ€™ve shared successes, navigated challenges, and made lasting memories. I am grateful for the experiences and knowledge Iâ€™ve gained, which will guide me in my future endeavors.

Though I'm stepping into a new chapter, I carry with me the invaluable lessons and friendships formed here. I hope our paths cross again, and I look forward to hearing about your future achievements.

Please stay in touch via [Your Personal Email] or [LinkedIn/Another Platform].

Wishing you all the best.

Warm regards,  
[Your Name]
