## Feature: Full Life Cycle Verification via Penny Transaction

### Description
As a system user, I want to verify the full transaction life cycle using a penny transaction so that I can ensure the payment processing system is functioning correctly.

### So That I Can
- Ensure the payment system processes transactions correctly through all involved systems.
- Detect and resolve any issues in the payment process at various stages, such as payment validation, fraud check, sanctions screening, funds availability check, posting, and confirmation.
- Ensure that the system is reliable and compliant with all required standards and regulations.

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Setup Systems:**
  - **Payment Validation:** The system should be able to validate the penny transaction and flag any anomalies.
  - **Fraud Check:** The system should screen for fraudulent activities and flag suspicious transactions.
  - **Sanctions Screening:** The system should screen the transaction against sanctions lists and flag any matches.
  - **Funds Availability:** The system should verify that sufficient funds are available before processing the transaction.
  - **Posting and Confirmation:** The system should correctly post the transaction and send confirmation notifications.

- **Transaction Processing:**
  - The system processes a penny transaction and deducts one penny from the sender's account.
  - The sender's transaction history shows the penny transaction with a "Completed" status.
  - The receiver's transaction history shows the penny transaction with a "Completed" status.
  - The system can reverse the penny transaction, crediting one penny back to the sender's account.
  - The sender's transaction history shows the reversal with a "Reversed" status.
  - The receiver's transaction history shows the reversal with a "Reversed" status.
  - Notifications are sent upon successful completion and reversal of the transaction.
